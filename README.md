# AWS---AI-Practitioner-
My idea and project named EduHelper was created from my personal work experience. As I have been an educator myself for over 15 years, I am always trying to find ways that can improve the efficiency of the learning process while helping educators gain confidence in their teaching styles as well. As I am using ChatGPT to organize and implement my project, I realized that I needed to first gain enough knowledge about AI. Hence I am using ChatGPT to learn about AWS AI Practitioner. As my project will be using an AI similar to ChatGPT (LLM) so I also wanted to check ChatGPT7's performance in teaching a person.
