📘 Topic 9: Evaluation & Feedback Loop in AI Systems

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	How AI systems evaluate outputs and measure success
	•	The importance of feedback for model improvement
	•	How evaluation differs between exam theory and project application
	•	How EduHelper can adapt lesson plans using feedback

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these concepts (exam + project safe):
	•	Evaluation Metrics
Measures used to determine if AI outputs are correct or effective.
	•	Feedback Loop
A process where AI uses outcomes to improve future outputs.
	•	Continuous Improvement
AI systems learn over time from new data and corrections.
	•	Teacher Feedback
Human input that refines AI-generated lesson plans.
	•	Student Feedback
Engagement and comprehension data that informs lesson adjustments.
	•	Adaptive AI
AI that changes its behavior based on evaluation and feedback.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 9 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is a feedback loop in AI?
	•	Why evaluation is important for AI performance?
	•	How can AI learn from errors or corrections?
	•	Why continuous improvement is critical in real-world AI?
	•	How is evaluation different in theory vs practice?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	How does AWS measure AI service effectiveness?
	•	Does AWS support retraining models using feedback?
	•	How can AWS services handle new classroom data?
	•	Why monitoring AI output is necessary in education systems?
	•	How does AWS help beginners integrate evaluation metrics?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	How will EduHelper collect teacher feedback?
	•	How will student comprehension inform AI suggestions?
	•	Why is evaluation needed before updating lesson plan logic?
	•	How does feedback improve lesson relevance over time?
	•	How can AI suggest improvements without overriding teacher control?

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	AI learns from what works and what doesn’t
	•	Feedback helps improve lesson suggestions
	•	Teachers’ input guides AI, not replaces them
	•	Student results shape future lessons
	•	Continuous improvement ensures lessons stay effective

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper uses both teacher and student feedback for adaptation
	•	AI evaluates lessons indirectly through engagement and comprehension
	•	Teachers approve changes before AI updates plans
	•	Feedback ensures AI remains relevant to real classrooms
	•	Continuous evaluation builds trust and improves outcomes
