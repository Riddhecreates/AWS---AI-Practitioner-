📘 Topic 2: AWS Global Infrastructure

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you should understand where AWS runs, why location matters, and how AWS stays reliable — especially for schools and real users.

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Know

You must clearly understand:
	•	What an AWS Region is
	•	What an Availability Zone (AZ) is
	•	What Edge Locations are
	•	Why AWS uses multiple physical locations
	•	Why latency matters for users

⸻

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done unless you can answer all of these in your own words.

⸻

A. Regions
	•	What is an AWS Region?
	•	Why does AWS have multiple Regions?
	•	Why would Japan need its own Region?
	•	What could go wrong if everything ran from one country?
	•	Which AWS Region would your project likely use?

⸻

B. Availability Zones (Very Important)
	•	What is an Availability Zone?
	•	How is an AZ different from a Region?
	•	Why does AWS use multiple AZs inside one Region?
	•	What happens if one AZ fails?
	•	How does this improve reliability for schools?

⸻

C. Edge Locations
	•	What is an Edge Location?
	•	How is it different from a Region?
	•	What kind of content uses Edge Locations?
	•	Why do Edge Locations reduce latency?
	•	Would Edge Locations matter for students using iPads?

⸻

D. Latency & User Experience
	•	What is latency (simple explanation)?
	•	Why does latency matter in classrooms?
	•	How would high latency affect students?
	•	Why do real-time tools need low latency?
	•	How does AWS reduce latency globally?

⸻

E. Your Project Connection (Critical)
	•	Why does your project need low latency?
	•	Why Japan-based infrastructure matters for Japanese schools?
	•	How Regions and AZs improve trust in the system?
	•	What would happen during a class if the system goes down?
	•	Why infrastructure reliability matters more than “cool AI”

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You should be able to say:
	•	“AWS has data centers all over the world”
	•	“Regions are countries/areas, AZs are separate buildings”
	•	“If one building fails, another takes over”
	•	“Closer servers = faster response”

If you can’t explain it simply, don’t move on.

⸻

4️⃣ Completion Criteria

You are done with Topic 2 only if:
	•	You can explain Regions, AZs, Edge Locations without notes
	•	You can explain why Japan needs local infrastructure
	•	You can relate reliability to classroom reality
	•	You can write one paragraph explaining why AWS infrastructure fits EduHelper
