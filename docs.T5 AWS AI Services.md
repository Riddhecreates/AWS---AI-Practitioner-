📘 Topic 5: AWS AI Services Overview

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must:
	•	Know what AWS AI services exist
	•	Understand what problem each service solves
	•	Clearly identify which ones are relevant and which are not for your project

⸻

1️⃣ What AWS Means by “AI Services”

AWS AI services are:
	•	Pre-trained
	•	Ready to use
	•	No model training required
	•	API-based

This means:

You use intelligence without building intelligence.

⸻

2️⃣ Core AWS AI Services You Must Know

You do not need all of them — but you must know what they do.

⸻

🔹 Amazon Comprehend (VERY IMPORTANT)

What it does
	•	Analyzes text
	•	Finds sentiment
	•	Extracts key phrases
	•	Detects themes

Why it matters for your project
	•	Teacher feedback analysis
	•	Student short response analysis
	•	Class reflection analysis

You must answer
	•	How can text analysis improve lesson planning?
	•	Why sentiment ≠ emotion detection?
	•	Why this is safe for education?

⸻

🔹 Amazon Personalize

What it does
	•	Recommendation system
	•	Learns user preferences

Why it matters
	•	Suggests lesson styles for teachers
	•	Adapts plans based on past success

You must answer
	•	What data does it need?
	•	Why it improves over time?
	•	Why teacher override is critical?

⸻

🔹 Amazon Forecast

What it does
	•	Predicts trends based on historical data

Why it matters
	•	Predict student engagement trends
	•	Identify patterns (not individuals)

You must answer
	•	Why forecasting trends is safer than predicting behavior?
	•	What kind of data is suitable?

⸻

🔹 Amazon Rekognition (Mostly NOT Needed)

What it does
	•	Image and video analysis

Why it is risky
	•	Facial analysis
	•	Privacy concerns
	•	Ethical issues in schools

You must answer
	•	Why you should avoid this
	•	Why surveys are better than vision analysis

⸻

3️⃣ Services You Should Explicitly Avoid (For Now)

You should be able to explain why you are not using them:
	•	Rekognition (privacy)
	•	Lex (voice in classroom)
	•	Polly (not required initially)

This shows maturity, not weakness.

4️⃣ Mapping AWS Services to the Project (Plain Text)

Project needs and corresponding AWS services:
	•	Text feedback analysis
→ Amazon Comprehend
	•	Lesson recommendation and personalization
→ Amazon Personalize
	•	Student engagement trend prediction over time
→ Amazon Forecast
	•	Storage of surveys, lesson plans, and metadata
→ Amazon S3
	•	Processing logic and automation
→ AWS Lambda

This mapping shows that:
	•	AI supports planning, not decision-making
	•	Human teachers remain fully in control
	•	No sensitive personal data is required

⸻

5️⃣ Questions You Must Be Able to Answer (Plain Text)

After completing this topic, I should be able to answer:
	•	Why using AWS AI services is better than building custom AI models at the beginning
	•	Which AWS AI services are appropriate and safe for use in an educational environment
	•	How student and teacher data can be processed without storing personal or identifiable information
	•	How AI supports lesson planning instead of replacing teachers
	•	Why teachers must always have final control over lesson decisions
	•	Why trend analysis is more ethical than individual prediction in classrooms

If you can answer these clearly, Topic 5 is complete.
