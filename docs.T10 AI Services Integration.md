📘 Topic 10: AWS AI Services Overview & Integration

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	What AWS AI services are available for beginners
	•	How these services simplify AI tasks (no need to build models from scratch)
	•	How to integrate AWS AI services into real applications
	•	How EduHelper can use AWS AI services effectively

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	AWS AI Services
Pre-built AI capabilities provided by AWS for tasks like text analysis, translation, speech recognition, and recommendations.
	•	Amazon Comprehend
NLP service for analyzing text, detecting sentiment, entities, and key phrases.
	•	Amazon Polly
Text-to-speech service for generating audio from text.
	•	Amazon Rekognition
Image and video analysis service for detecting objects, faces, and activities.
	•	Amazon Translate
Language translation service for converting text between languages.
	•	Amazon SageMaker
Service for building, training, and deploying custom ML models (optional for beginners).
	•	Integration Concept
Connecting AI services via APIs to an application without manual model building.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 10 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is the difference between pre-built AI services and building ML models from scratch?
	•	Why does AWS provide these services for beginners?
	•	How can AI services be combined in one application?
	•	Why is API integration important for developers?
	•	How do these services save time and effort in real projects?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	What AWS AI services are most relevant for education?
	•	Which service can analyze text feedback from students?
	•	Which service can generate lesson narration or audio content?
	•	Can AWS AI services work with PDFs or uploaded class materials?
	•	How do AWS pricing and limits affect small-scale projects?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	Which AWS service can help EduHelper analyze student surveys?
	•	Which AWS service can provide spoken versions of lesson plans?
	•	How can API calls connect AWS AI services to the EduHelper website?
	•	How do AWS services reduce the need to manually program AI logic?
	•	Which services can you integrate now, and which can be added later as the project scales?

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	AWS offers ready-to-use AI tools for common tasks
	•	You don’t need to program AI from scratch
	•	AI services can analyze text, speech, images, or translate languages
	•	Teachers’ input is still required to make final decisions
	•	Integration means AI suggestions appear directly in your website/tool

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper can use Amazon Comprehend for analyzing student feedback
	•	Polly can create audio for lessons or instructions
	•	Translate can help multi-language classrooms
	•	API integration connects the website to AWS AI services seamlessly
	•	Using AWS reduces development time and risk while keeping the project scalable
