📘 Topic 12: Data Privacy & Security in AI Systems

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	Why privacy and security are critical in AI applications
	•	How student and teacher data should be handled
	•	How AWS helps ensure secure AI services
	•	How EduHelper can implement safe data practices

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	Data Privacy
Protecting personal information from unauthorized access or misuse.
	•	Data Security
Measures to safeguard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
	•	Encryption
Converting data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized reading.
	•	Access Control
Restricting who can view or modify data.
	•	Anonymization / Pseudonymization
Removing personally identifiable information from data.
	•	Compliance Standards
Legal and ethical frameworks (e.g., GDPR, local education laws) for handling data.
	•	AWS Security Tools
Services like AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), encryption, and secure storage.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 12 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is the difference between privacy and security?
	•	Why is student data sensitive?
	•	What is encryption, and why is it important?
	•	How do access controls protect data?
	•	Why is compliance important even for small AI projects?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	How does AWS ensure data privacy in AI services?
	•	What is AWS IAM and how is it used?
	•	How can AWS encrypt data in storage and transit?
	•	Are AWS AI services GDPR-compliant?
	•	How does AWS manage secure access for multiple users?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	How will EduHelper protect student survey responses?
	•	How will teacher profile data remain confidential?
	•	Should AI results be stored temporarily or permanently?
	•	How can you ensure only authorized teachers access their class data?
	•	What steps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data in the website?

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	AI keeps personal data safe and private
	•	Only authorized people (teachers/admins) can see data
	•	Encryption protects data from hackers
	•	AI does not expose student info publicly
	•	Privacy laws guide how AI handles data

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper encrypts student and teacher data
	•	Teachers control who sees their class data
	•	AI uses anonymized feedback to improve lesson plans
	•	AWS security features reduce risk of data breaches
	•	Maintaining privacy ensures trust and adoption in schools
