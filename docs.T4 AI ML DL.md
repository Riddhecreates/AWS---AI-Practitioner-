📘 Topic 4: AI vs ML vs Deep Learning

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	The difference between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
	•	Where AWS services fit
	•	Why you don’t need to build models from scratch

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Systems that mimic human decision-making.
	•	Machine Learning (ML)
Systems that learn patterns from data.
	•	Deep Learning (DL)
ML using neural networks with many layers.

⸻

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 4 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is AI in simple words?
	•	Is AI always machine learning?
	•	Can a system be ML but not AI?
	•	Where does deep learning fit?
	•	Why is deep learning powerful but expensive?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	Does AWS expect beginners to build AI models?
	•	Why does AWS provide pre-built AI services?
	•	What problem does this solve for teachers?
	•	Why is this safer in an education system?
	•	Why is AWS AI more about using than training?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	What type of AI does your project use?
	•	Why is ML enough for teacher feedback analysis?
	•	Why deep learning is optional, not required
	•	Why automation ≠ intelligence
	•	Why AI supports teachers, not replaces them

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	AI helps make decisions
	•	ML finds patterns in student data
	•	DL is powerful but not always necessary
	•	AWS already provides ready-to-use AI tools
	•	Teachers remain in control

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	Your system uses applied AI
	•	AI analyzes trends, not emotions directly
	•	Human judgment remains final
	•	AI suggests, teachers decide
	•	This avoids ethical risks
