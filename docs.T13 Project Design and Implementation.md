📘 Topic 13: Project Design & Implementation Strategy

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	How to design an AI system from idea to implementation
	•	How AWS AI services and LLMs fit into a project workflow
	•	How to plan EduHelper’s architecture for scalability, privacy, and usability
	•	How to align project design with real classroom constraints

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	System Architecture
The layout of components and how they interact in an AI system.
	•	Input-Process-Output (IPO) Model
Framework to define what goes in (data), how it is processed (AI), and what comes out (lesson plans).
	•	Data Flow
How data moves through the system from collection to output.
	•	Integration
Connecting multiple AWS services and AI components seamlessly.
	•	User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)
How teachers and students interact with the system easily.
	•	Feedback Loop
Mechanism for AI to learn from teacher/student responses and improve recommendations.
	•	Scalability
System’s ability to handle more teachers, students, or subjects without redesign.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 13 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What are the key components of an AI system for education?
	•	What is the IPO model, and why is it useful?
	•	How does data flow from students/teachers to AI and back?
	•	What is a feedback loop, and why is it critical?
	•	Why is scalability important for future growth?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	Which AWS services fit each stage of the EduHelper system?
	•	How does AWS support integration between LLMs and other AI services?
	•	How can AWS ensure smooth scaling as the number of users grows?
	•	How does AWS security and privacy tools support implementation?
	•	Which services allow real-time processing versus batch processing?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	How will EduHelper implement IPO for each lesson plan?
	•	How will teacher surveys, student mood, and content PDF be processed?
	•	How can the AI suggest improvements while keeping teachers in control?
	•	How will the system store and update feedback for continuous learning?
	•	How will the UI/UX design ensure adoption by Japanese teachers and students?

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	EduHelper takes input (teacher, student, content), processes it using AI, and outputs lesson plans
	•	Teachers adjust the suggestions based on their classroom needs
	•	The system learns over time from feedback
	•	AWS helps manage AI tasks without building models from scratch
	•	UI is simple; teachers and students don’t need technical knowledge

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper’s architecture integrates AWS AI services, LLMs, and secure storage
	•	IPO model ensures systematic handling of inputs and outputs
	•	Feedback loop enables adaptive lesson planning
	•	Scalability ensures future growth across multiple schools and subjects
	•	Human oversight remains central, maintaining ethical and effective teaching
