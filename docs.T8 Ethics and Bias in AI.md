📘 Topic 8: Ethics, Bias & Human Oversight in AI

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	Why ethics is critical in AI systems
	•	How bias can appear in AI models
	•	The importance of human judgment in AI outputs
	•	How AWS and EduHelper ensure ethical AI use

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	AI Ethics
Principles guiding AI to be fair, transparent, and responsible.
	•	Bias
Systematic errors in AI output caused by skewed data or assumptions.
	•	Fairness
AI should not favor or discriminate against certain groups.
	•	Transparency
AI decision-making should be explainable to humans.
	•	Human-in-the-Loop
Humans review, approve, or modify AI suggestions before final use.
	•	Accountability
Responsibility lies with AI designers and users, not the AI itself.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 8 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is AI ethics in simple words?
	•	How does bias enter an AI system?
	•	Why is fairness important in education AI?
	•	What is the difference between transparency and explainability?
	•	Why can’t AI be fully autonomous in classrooms?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	How does AWS guide ethical AI use?
	•	Does AWS provide bias detection tools?
	•	Why is explainability built into AWS AI services?
	•	How can AWS cloud AI maintain student privacy?
	•	Why is human oversight recommended even with pre-built AI services?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	How will EduHelper avoid biased suggestions?
	•	How do teacher overrides prevent unfair lesson plans?
	•	Why student privacy must be protected in surveys and feedback?
	•	How does transparency help teachers trust AI?
	•	Why AI should suggest, not decide, in lesson planning?

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	AI suggestions are not final answers
	•	AI can be biased if data is incomplete or skewed
	•	Teachers remain in control of the lessons
	•	Privacy and fairness are built-in considerations
	•	Transparency ensures teachers understand AI logic

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper incorporates human-in-the-loop review
	•	Bias is minimized through diverse data and teacher oversight
	•	Student and teacher privacy is protected at all times
	•	AI provides suggestions, teachers make final decisions
	•	Ethical design is integral to system adoption in schools
