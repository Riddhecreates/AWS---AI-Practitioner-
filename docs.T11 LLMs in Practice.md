📘 Topic 11: Large Language Models (LLMs) in Practice

🎯 Goal of this topic

By the end of this topic, you must clearly understand:
	•	What Large Language Models (LLMs) are and how they work
	•	The difference between LLMs and traditional AI models
	•	How AWS supports LLMs for beginners
	•	How EduHelper can leverage LLMs for lesson plan generation and student engagement

⸻

1️⃣ Core Concepts You MUST Understand

You only need these definitions (exam + project safe):
	•	Large Language Model (LLM)
AI model trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human-like language.
	•	Natural Language Processing (NLP)
AI capability to read, understand, and respond to text or speech.
	•	Generative AI
AI that can create new content (text, summaries, answers) rather than just analyzing existing data.
	•	Prompting
The input or instructions given to an LLM to generate output.
	•	Fine-tuning
Adjusting an LLM on specific data to perform a particular task better.
	•	Applications
Summarization, Q&A, chatbots, content generation, personalized lesson plans.

2️⃣ Questions You MUST Be Able to Answer

You are not done with Topic 11 unless you can answer all of these.

⸻

A. Conceptual Understanding
	•	What is an LLM in simple words?
	•	How does LLM differ from traditional AI or ML models?
	•	Why is LLM considered generative AI?
	•	What is a “prompt” and why is it important?
	•	Can LLMs make mistakes? Why?

⸻

B. AWS Perspective
	•	Does AWS offer LLM services? (e.g., Amazon Bedrock)
	•	How can beginners use LLMs without building models from scratch?
	•	How does AWS handle scaling and performance for LLMs?
	•	Can AWS LLMs process text from multiple sources like PDFs, feedback, or lesson plans?
	•	How does AWS ensure ethical use of LLMs?

⸻

C. Project Relevance
	•	How can EduHelper use LLMs to generate daily or chapter-wise lesson plans?
	•	How can LLMs suggest alternative wording for teacher instructions or prompts?
	•	How can LLMs summarize student feedback for teachers?
	•	Why is human oversight needed even when LLMs generate lesson content?
	•	How can fine-tuning LLMs help improve EduHelper’s recommendations over time?

⸻

3️⃣ Things You Should Be Able to Explain Simply

You must be able to explain to a non-technical teacher:
	•	LLMs understand and generate text like a human
	•	They can suggest lesson plans, examples, and variations in language
	•	Teachers still decide what to use; AI only assists
	•	Feedback and inputs from teachers improve AI suggestions
	•	LLMs save time, especially when creating multiple lesson variations

⸻

4️⃣ Project Connection (Critical)

You should clearly state:
	•	EduHelper leverages LLMs to create adaptive, personalized lesson plans
	•	LLMs analyze student surveys, teacher style, and class materials
	•	AI generates suggestions, but teachers retain final control
	•	Fine-tuning LLMs allows better alignment with Japanese classroom norms
	•	Using LLMs ensures scalability: one system can support multiple subjects and teachers
