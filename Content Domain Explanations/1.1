**Describe the similarities and differences between AI, ML, Generative AI, and Deep Learning**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the broadest concept, focused on making machines perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where systems learn from data instead of following fixed rules. Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn complex patterns, especially from unstructured data like images and text. Generative AI is built mainly on deep learning and focuses on creating new content such as text, images, or audio rather than just predicting outcomes. In short: AI defines the goal, ML defines learning from data, deep learning defines how complex learning happens, and Generative AI defines content creation.

Example:
A rule-based chatbot is AI but not ML.
A spam filter is ML.
Face recognition uses deep learning.
ChatGPT-style systems are Generative AI.
