**Deﬁne the concepts and constructs of prompt engineering (for example, context, instruction,  negative prompts, model latent space, prompt routing).**

Prompt engineering is the practice of structuring inputs to guide how a foundation model behaves at inference time. For the AWS AI Practitioner exam, prompt engineering is treated as a low-cost, high-impact control mechanism that shapes accuracy, safety, and consistency without modifying the model itself. Prompt engineering reduces cost, improves accuracy, and avoids unnecessary customization. It is often the first and preferred method of controlling GenAI behavior in AWS architectures before fine-tuning or retraining. In exam questions, if the goal is control, safety, or cost reduction without training, the correct answer almost always involves prompt engineering.

*Context*

Context provides background information the model needs to generate relevant responses. It frames the task, defines boundaries, and reduces ambiguity. Well-defined context helps the model stay grounded, while poor context increases hallucinations and irrelevant output. Context directly affects token usage and cost.
Business example: Providing product documentation context before asking support questions.
Exam cues: Keywords- “background information,” “grounding,” “reduce ambiguity.”

*Instruction*

Instructions explicitly tell the model what to do, how to respond, and what format to follow. Clear instructions reduce variability and improve determinism. Weak or vague instructions lead to inconsistent outputs even with the same model. Instructions are critical for enterprise and regulated use cases.
Business example: “In 3 bullet points, summarize the policy using neutral language.”
Exam cues: Look for “explicit task definition,” “output format.”
